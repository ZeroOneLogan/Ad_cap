# PWA Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the PWA:

- icon-72x72.png
- icon-96x96.png
- icon-128x128.png
- icon-144x144.png
- icon-152x152.png
- icon-192x192.png
- icon-384x384.png
- icon-512x512.png

You can generate these icons from a single high-resolution source image using tools like:
- https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageresizer
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- ImageMagick command line tools

For now, the app will work without these icons, but they should be added before production deployment.
